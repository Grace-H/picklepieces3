Check Words Algorithm
1. Itterate over array
	a. is it start of word going accross
		- bool connected
		- is it the first letter in the row
		- is there a blank behind it
		i. read each letter into string until blank or end of row
			- is at least one connected to something above or below
		ii. one connected letter: ignore
		iii. one unconnected letter: problem
		iv. unconnected: problem
		v. connected word: CheckWord
	b. is it start of word going down
		- bool connected
		- is it the first letter in the column
		- is there a blank behind it
		i. read each letter into string until blank or end of column
			- is at least one connected to something on either side
		ii. one connected letter: ignore
		iii. one unconnected letter: problem
		iv. unconnected: problem
		v. connected word: CheckWord		
bool CheckWord:
	itterate over array
	compare word to array until found
	if not found return false	
	
- Doesn't check for if there are two crosswords
